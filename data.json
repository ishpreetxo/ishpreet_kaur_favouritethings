        "brief": "Painting is that one thing which I would never get tired of doing! For me, it is like an emotion. I love to play with colours and put my ideas on a piece of paper. Mostly, I like to make sceneries and landscapes. I consider painting as a stress-relief activity so I have fun to draw & paint when I feel low.",

I learned different forms of dance and I always used to perform in my school functions. I like Hip-Hop a little too much! I don't even need a reason to dance, it just lifts up my mood in seconds!",
